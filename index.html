      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Througout my life I have always been designing house rules for board/card games that tweak the experience in ways I wanted.  Being a budding software developer I am fascinated and curious about all the levers, pulleys, and ways to tweak things that happen behind and throughout a computer screen.  I am inspired to learn more about these levers and pulleys that help create effective templates that I can use/adjust not just for games, but for my own personal use and productivity.</p>
